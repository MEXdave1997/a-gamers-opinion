There are very few how as of late that have garnered my attention. Some,
because they have tropes that I have grown tired of. Others, because I can’t
really identify with the characters. Almost always, its due to the fact that these
story just wasn’t engrosing enough for me. That was mos definitely NOT the
case for Fate/Zero, a show that I should have watched earlier, but I am glad to 
have finished not too long ago.

# Story
## Introduction and Warning
So, the story of Fate/Zero is kind of hard to discuss due to how complex the
show gets and how messy character connections get, so reading further is strictly up to you. After this point, I will have assumed that readers will have watched the original Fate/Stay Night anime, or have played through the visual novel.

## Summary 
The story revolves around the Holy Grail Wars, as was with the initial Fate/Stay
Night anime and visual novel.The story itself again focuses on the servant Saber,
but this time, is set during the 4th Holy Grail War (thus making this a prequel
to the original series). Her master, Kiritsugu Emiya, is renowned for being the
great ”Magus Killer”. Over the course of the series, he is working on behalf
of the Einzbern family in their quest to obtain the Grail. in that journey, he
use the tools and skills he’s acquired to reach that end. This includes both normal weaponry (guns, knives, explosives, etc.), and magic. Many of his fellow
Masters are However, when given the opportunity to actually claim the Grail,
he refuses, having realized the true nature behind it's power.

## Overall Story Impressions
All in all, I like the story portrayed here. It's a really good balance between
mystery and intrigue that is difficult to portray. The story also provides some
pretty great information on back story and motivations behind both the main
characters (Saber and Kiritsugu), as well as setting the stage really nicely for
what comes to pass in Fate/Stay Night.

# Character Development
## Introduction
For this show, the characters I will focus on are Kiritsugu, Saber, Kirei Kotomine,
and Gilgamesh . These characters, in my opinion, are the most interesting
ones to focus on as well as the relationships they ultimately develop with
each other.

## Kiritsugu Emiya and Saber
The official main characters of this series, Kiritsugu and Saber develop very interesting relationships with each other, as well as different motivations that more often than not collided with one another. For Kiritsugu, the Grail has always been the means to which he will save the world, to be the hero that can bring about the miracle of ”World
peace”. For Saber, the Grail was a chance for her to rebuild her country as she
knew it, and to be able to save it from what she calls damnation. However,
her pride as a knight leads her down a very conflicting path with Emiya, as he
employs very dishonorable methods in her eyes (killing by deceiving, etc.). And
while their ideals and motivations seem the same, they constantly are at odds
with how to employ them. Ultimately, the struggle of ideals comes to a head in
the final moments of the series, with Saber ultimately seeing that her ideals are
what lead to her countries ruin in the first place, and Kiritsugu realizing that a
perfect utopia just cannot be achieved.

## Kirei Kotomine and Gilgamesh
These two characters have a very interesting relationship indeed. They start
out a ”enemies” (Kirei initially starting out as the master of an assassin class
servant, and later losing him completely midway through the war, and Gilgamesh
bound to a different mater), but gradually they come to know each other because
Kirei was working with the mater of Gilgamesh. AS the series progresses, we
start to see Kirei grow from someone who cares not about what the grail could
offer, to ultimately wanting it to find out what he wants from life. In this
sense, Gilgamesh pushed him to seek this goal, and ultimately has the overseer
of the war as well as Gilgamesh’s master murdered. They then develop a mutual
companionship, one in which Gilgamesh achieves his initial goal of entertainment,
and Kirei can get Gilgamesh to help him achieve his goal of finding the grail to figure out his purpose for wanting it in the first place.

## Overall Character Development Impressions
This was the strongest point in the show for me. Having watched the original
Fate/Stay Night a while back and having known who a lot of these characters
were, I felt that their motivations fit their intended roles to the show. The clash
between the characters mentioned above is the real highlight of the show, and
displays a lot of what human nature is as a whole; the idealists who push for a
better society only to see that its more than one could take head on, and the
person who is just looking to find his purpose and meaning of existence.

# Themes
This show is very vast and explores a lot of themes regarding the nature of
people and why we yearn for things. The concept of being able to find one’s
true motivations are I think the biggest one in the entire series. Not only does it
create a character (Kirei), but it is also a big problem for Saber and Kiritsugu
as it goe on. At first, they believe they have a clear goal and clear reasons for
that goal. As they press forward however, they find that they may not really
be going about their goals for the right reason, and by the end are really seeking
to find out why they do what they do. For Saber, she learn that maybe the
motive of rebuilding the kingdom she once sought to save may have already
been doomed from the get go. For Kiritugu, he learn that the Grail may not
really be a powerful with granter, and in’t even ure if his dream is even possible
to attain by the end.

The Grail itself may be a them for that ultimate purpose in life that all the character fighting for want to achieve. This problem of who gets the Grail
can be a reference to the way many people often fight, and have to trample
other, to attain their own goal. For instance, servants like Rider, who’s dream
it was to find the last ocean to the far east, he had to try to go on a ”conquest”,
in order to try to reach the Grail and help him reach that ocean. For Saber,
the idea of being able to save her kingdom meant defeating the other servants
and showing them her power and resolve to attain it.

## Final Impressions on Themes
With these themes alone, the series really highlights, what I feel, are problems
with the human condition as a whole. The finding a purpose theme is especially
crucial, as many people (including me) feel lost and without purpose. However,
the show portrays some sort of hope, in the fact that the more you keep pushing
forward, the easier it becomes to find that goal and pursue it.

# Final Thoughts
As I gather my final thoughts, all I can really say is this. This show is one
that is covered from head to toe with pure emotion. The show does an amazing
job of portraying motivations, goals, aspirations, and just overall raw character
development into one amazing package. I give credit to whoever had a hand in
doing this, as I feel they did an excellent job in trying to set the stage for the
series to come.The only real qualm I had about it was that it wasn’t really long
enough to get a feel for everyone in the cast, side characters included. Despite
that however, the show was brilliantly built and is deserving of a watch.
