Well, here we are. coming back to one of my favorite series. This one being a sequel to my favorite must watch *Steins;Gate.*
However, this show needs a lot of work, in my opinion, and while there are definitely some pretty good moments in the show, there is a lot to be desired in how they handled the narrative.

# Story
## Introduction
This show's main problem comes down to the way the story was told.
Admittedly, the problems stems from the way the production company decideed to interpret the source material, the visual novel of the same name.

Steins;gate Zero is set in a timeline where Kurisu is dead, Mayuri is alive, and Okabe has basically forbidden himself or anyone for his friends to revisit time traveling. He has since been going back to school and doing pretty well for himself, even going so far as getting attention to be coinsidered for a study abroad program in America. Then he meets Maho Hiyajo, a Neuroscientist from Victor Chondria Univesity in the US at a confrence, and subsequently learns about Amadeus, the AI representation of his dead crush, Makise Kurisu. The rest of the series really focuses on Okabe as he not only rediscovers his formoer goal of reaching his Steins;Gate, and why it mattered so much for him.

While tis seems to be a really strong story, the pacing of the overall plot shifts so much that it loses the desired effect a lot of the time. Combine that with the fact that there are several sideplots that are introduced but never really explored, and you have a recipe for poor story execution.

# Character Development
## Introduction
While story was pretty lax, I still have a belief that thwe character development was really strong for all characters involved in this show. In particular, we are going to look at Okabe Rintarou (again) and Maho Hiyajo.

## Okabe Rintarou
So how has Okabe changed this time around? Well, initially, he seems to be less of a shutin type of character and has really shown just how capable he is at surviving with people outside his inner circle. He is a good student with decent marks that is acknowledged as capable of taking a study abroad program.

This persona, however, is merely a mask. Inside, he is a man who is worn and broken by the constant knowledge of having failed those he has loved. His many attempts at saving Mayuri, of having to reverse the many D-Mails his friends have made knowing full well they will end up hurt as a result, the realization that Kurisu is dead becausse HE stabbed her, torments him. He is, in the beginning at least, at the lowest point of his life, having realized that nothing he has done to rewrite the past has gone well. 

As the show progresses, he starts to show more and more just how broken he is. He slowly breaks down, displaying his emotions to his friends, and him coming to terms with the fact that he needs to move forward in order to fix his mistakes. This happens about midway through the show, where after coming back from the future timeline and realizing why he went as far as he did in the first place: for his friends. He comes to the realiztion that in order to reach his original dream of getting to the perfect timeline of *Steins;Gate*. he needs to first take on his original "Mad Scienist" persona once more and pursue that world line.

## Maho Hiyajo
Now onto Maho, the neuroscientist from the USA. She is a character who, at first anyway, seems very stuck up and sensitive, especially when it comes to matters of her size (paricularly height). She is intellegent, and shows to have immense experience in her field. She first meets Okabe after a talk she had given regarding storing human memories and AI. She welcomes Okabe into the fray, recognizing that his knowledge of Kurisu is crucial for the AI Amadeus. 

Her character grows in a suprising aspect: her competitve nature and her desire to become like her dear deceased friend, Makise Kurisu. See, initially, we learn that she and Kurisu had a really close coworker relationship, seeing each other as relative equals. However, at the same time, she felt that she was slowly drifting into the shadow of her friend, being unrecognized and ignored while Kurisu and her publication garnered lots of attention. This wasn't out of jealousy, so much as the realiztion of how inferior she felt to her friends genius.

After meeting Okabe, however, we learn a couple of things about her. For starters, she had been trying over the course of the series to unlock Kurisu's laptop, trying to discover what she had. This is quickly ended however in a run-in with people working for Russia, as they destroy the laptop. Maho is clearly horrified by this, believeing that all of her firend's life work is gone, and her not knowing it make it hurt even more. Okabe manages to get her to see reason, explaining that Kurisu's work doesn't have to be her work, and to move past that.      

## Overall Character Development Impressions
All in all, the character development side of things is pretty amazing, with characters having issues might not be as relatable, but still very impactful to the audience.

# Final Thoughts
Ok, so this show has a lot of problems. It's plot is a pretty big mess to untangle, the characters could have been much better written, tho they still have some pretty good aspects, and the pacing could have been better. Howwever, its attention to detail and willingness to stick to the main story line of the visual novel is truly praiseworthy. All in all, I recommend this for viewers who are absolute fans of the series, and for the viewer who is willing to take the bad with the good, especially when coming from the original show.
