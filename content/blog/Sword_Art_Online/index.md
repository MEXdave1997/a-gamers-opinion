This is THE show that got me into anime, and the bias may show. 
But for today, I will be looking at **Sword Art Online**, an anime about a killer VRMMORPG and the struggle to survive.
This show has had a pretty bad rap ever since its release.
The state of the show has been one of many trials and tribulations, plagued by patchy writing, and a mishmash of scenarios that had to work to gether in some form or another.
**Sword Art Online** encompasses the journey of a boy named Kazuto Kirigaya, or Kirito as he is known in-game.
We follow him on his quest to beat the game so he can leave this world, and meets many friends along the way.
