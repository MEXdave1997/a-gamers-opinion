This is THE show that got me into anime, and the bias may show. 
But for today, I will be looking at **Sword Art Online**, an anime about a killer VRMMORPG and the struggle to survive.
This show has had a pretty bad rap ever since its release.
The state of the show has been one of many trials and tribulations, plagued by patchy writing, and a mishmash of scenarios that had to work to gether in some form or another.
**Sword Art Online** encompasses the journey of a boy named Kazuto Kirigaya, or Kirito as he is known in-game.
We follow him on his quest to beat the game so he can leave this world, and meets many friends along the way.

## Story
So what is **Sword Art Online**? Well, the show revolves around a boy named Kazuto Kirigaya, an addict gamer, and beta tester for the newest VR game genre to hit the market, a widely hyped VRMMO called, no suprisingly, **Sword Art Online**. 
It is a game that he and 10,000 other players who were able to pick up an initial copy for the game. 
And it starts off in a simple enough way. 
Kazuto, or Kirito as he is known in the game world, by trying to find his a starter quest. 
Before he could do that though, he is approached by Klein, who asks for his assistance in learning the ins and outs of the game.
After a few hours of this, Klein decides to try and log out of game, only to find that the "Logout" option in the menu of the game is missing.
This is reinforced a few seconds later, and is revealed that that disappearance of that option is not a bug, but a feature of the world, and that in order to successfully leave the game, the players have to work together to beat the main quest, climbing up the 100 floors of the world of Aincrad.

## Character Development
While this show isn't exactly known for its vast character development, there is still enough to be able to cover in this section. In this case however, we will strictly look at Kirito, mainly due to the focus on him in the plot overall.

### Kazuto Kirigaya (Kirito)
So who is Kazuto? Well, we first learn that he is a beta tester for Sword Art as well as a video game junkie. We get a sense that he has spent an incredible amount of time on playing the beta. We also learn that he isn't much of a social butterfly, prefering to be solo whenever possible.
