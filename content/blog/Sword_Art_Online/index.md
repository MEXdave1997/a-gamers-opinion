For me, college was a very interesting venture.
At 17, I was a college freshman, majoring in Sociology, and was prepared to take on anything that came my way.
However, life got in the way, and it stopped me in my tracks. I was, for a lack of a better term, stuck. 
I jumped into the workforce, and remember the work I had to put in to keep up with my expenses, and that provided me with a larger world, one filled with lots of miscellaneous challenges.
It's been 4 years since then, and the world has given me a new resaon to jump back on the horse, and to pursue higher education again.
All these events were eye-opening, providing me with an even larger understanding of the world around me, and a bigger appreciation for the little details in life.
Things like appreciating time with family and friends, dedicating time to find myself, and really accepting the flaws in the world and running with them.

Such was my foray into the world of anime.
A vast world that I had been introduced to at a relatively early age (***Dragonball Z***, ***Pokemon***, and/or ***Yugioh***, anyone?), but I had had no real clue that they were anime until I was well into my high school career.
My first true foray into the world of anime, geared with the knowledge that it was such, is ***Sword Art Online***.
This is a show that I remember with a fondness, as it was my gateway into a larger world of anime.
A world where the only limits to what exist is really what you can imagine.

***Sword Art Online*** introduced me to a world where technology had provided people with vast virtual worlds in which you can actually LIVE in.
Worlds that have all the vital senses at your displosal, and a whole new world to really explore.
This show provided me a sort of escape into a world of the typical MMO, where the fastest power-leveler can becomme virtually unbeatable.
And sadly, that provides one of the most criticised aspects of the show: its protaganist, Kazuto Kirigaya, or Kirito as he is known in the world of Aincrad.

Kirito is introduced pretty plainly: a solitary boy who has very little going for him, most likely depressive, and is itching to get in-game for some hours of mindless fun. And for a while he does. As he was one of only 1,000 people who got to beta test ***Sword Art Online***, he more or less understands the functions of the world, and is very quickly able to get used to the mechanisms of the world.
