This is THE show that got me into anime, and the bias may show. 
But for today, I will be looking at **Sword Art Online**, an anime about a killer VRMMORPG and the struggle to survive.
This show has had a pretty bad rap ever since its release.
The state of the show has been one of many trials and tribulations, plagued by patchy writing, and a mishmash of scenarios that had to work to gether in some form or another.
**Sword Art Online** encompasses the journey of a boy named Kazuto Kirigaya, or Kirito as he is known in-game.
We follow him on his quest to beat the game so he can leave this world, and meets many friends along the way.

## Story
So what is **Sword Art Online**. Well, the how revolve around a boy named Kazuto Kirigaya, an adict gamer, and beta testter for the newest VR game genre to hit the market, a widely hyped VRMMO called, no suprisingly, **Sword Art Online**. It is known that he was actually a beta tester for this game, and is one of 10,000 other players who were able to pick up an initial copy for the game. And it starts off in a simple enough way. Kazuto, or Kirito as he is known in the game world, by trying to find his a starter quest. Before he could do that though, he is approached by Klein, who asks for his assistance in learning the ins and outs of the game.
